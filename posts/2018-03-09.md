## Overview

GraphQL is an exceptional technology that allows APIs to be more efficient and expressive. GORM is the object relational mapper used by Grails that enables developers to interact with both relational and document databases through the declaration of simple Groovy classes.

In this 55-minute webinar, 2GM (Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut) team member, [James Kleeh](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#kleeh), discusses in depth a new GORM extension and Grails plugin that combine these two great technologies and increase developer productivity.
