Recently, the Grails Framework Artifactory instance was updated and as a result all HTTP requests to the repository are being redirected over HTTPS.  That is a good thing, but unfortunately it caused [an issue](https://github.com/grails/grails-wrapper/issues/7) as our `grails-wrapper.jar` was hardcoded to download from HTTP and was not able to follow redirects.

We are preparing a patch release of Grails 4 and Grails 3 to make new applications work with the change, but for existing Grails 3 and Grails 4 applications the `grailsw` command will fail if the necessary assets haven't already been cached on the machine.

The error received is:

```
You must be connected to the internet the first time you use the Grails wrapper
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 6; columnNumber: 3; The element type "hr" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</hr>".

```

## Updating Existing Projects

To fix this, replace the `grails-wrapper.jar` file in the base of your existing project with one of the updated wrappers below:

+ [Updated grails-wrapper.jar for Grails 3 Projects](/files/wrapper-issue7/grails3/grails-wrapper.jar) [(MD5)](/files/wrapper-issue7/grails3/grails-wrapper.jar.md5)
+ [Updated grails-wrapper.jar for Grails 4 Projects](/files/wrapper-issue7/grails4/grails-wrapper.jar) [(MD5)](/files/wrapper-issue7/grails4/grails-wrapper.jar.md5)

Running the `grailsw` command from within the project should now work as expected.

## Changing Repository URL

In addition to removing the hard-coded HTTP URL, we have also added the ability to change the base URL that the wrapper uses.

There are two possible mechanisms for doing this:

+ Setting an environment variable named `GRAILS_CORE_ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL`
+ Setting the `grails.core.artifactory.baseUrl` system property

The default value is `https://repo.grails.org/grails/core` and we do not expect that to change.

## Wrapping Up

We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced by this recent change.  We will be posting a more detailed post-mortem on these events in the next few days.  Please continue to report [any issues](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues) you encounter.
