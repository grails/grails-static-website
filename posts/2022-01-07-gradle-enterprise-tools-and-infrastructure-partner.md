The Grails Foundation™ is truly appreciative of the tremendous support we receive from our sponsors. In addition to financial support, generous contributions of development tools, infrastructure, and other resources are essential to the continued evolution of the Grails® framework. Thus, we have established a new partnership program to recognize the companies whose contributions enable us to maintain and expand both the open source technologies and the assets we rely on to keep our communities informed and engaged.

Today, we are pleased to announce that Gradle Inc," providers of [Gradle Build Tool](https://grails.org) and [Gradle Enterprise](https://gradle.com).  has joined the [Grails Foundation](https://gradle.org/foundation/index.html) as our first Tools and Infrastructure Partner! In support of our organizations' shared values and goals within the open source ecosystem, Gradle provides the Foundation free instances of [Gradle Enterprise](https://gradle.com).

Gradle Enterprise has helped our team to improve build times and test-feedback cycle times, and improve troubleshooting efficiency by combining root-cause analysis data with failure analytics.

We’re delighted to have Gradle on board as a Tools and Infrastructure Partner. The Gradle team's support and excitement for the Grails technology over the years has been tremendous. Their engagement in our community has been awesome, and we look forward to continued collaboration in the years to come. We truly appreciate the dedication and passion Gradle has for open source projects. On behalf of the Grails Foundation, thank you! Initiatives like these that support and grow our Framework are the kinds of things we look for in a lifelong technology partner.

The Grails Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that supports the Grails framework. The Foundation not only builds and supports an ecosystem of documentation, functionality, and services, it promotes and evangelizes the Framework as a leading technology in the JVM space. The generous support of our [Corporate Sponsors](https://grails.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#corporate) allows the Foundation to continue to ensure technical innovation and advancement of the Framework as a free and open public-use software development toolkit for our growing global community.
