## Generating the MAIN site

[https://grails.org](https://grails.org)

```bash
./gradlew build --console=plain
```

The output can be found in the `build/dist` directory.

## Generating the GUIDES site

[https://guides.grails.org](http://guides.grails.org)

```bash
./gradlew buildGuide --console=plain

```
The output can be found in the `build/dist` directory.

## Running the website locally

The easiest way to work locally is to generate the site and setup your Webserver to serve build/dist. 

For example with [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/):

You can also use Python to serve the directory:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory build/dist
```

## Blog Posts

### Posts Location

Write blog posts in markdown at `posts` folder.

### Blog post Metadata

A post supports metadata at the beginning of the document. You can use it store information (title, description, publication date) about your blog posts. 

Metadata must be separated from the rest of the document by three dashes.

You can use the metadata in the text by putting it in brackets adding a % sign.

A typical blog post will look like: 

```markdown

We had [previously](http://grails.io/post/142674392718/deploying-grails-3-to-wildfly-10) described how to deploy Grails 3.1 applications to WildFly 10, which is where all of the "cutting edge" work happens in the JBoss world.

The process to deploy Grails 3.1 applications to JBoss 6.4 EAP is largely similar, with some minor configuration differences.

#### Text Expander snippets

If you write often to Micronaut's blog, we recommend you to create a [Text Expander](https://textexpander.com) snippet:

 ![](docs/textexpander.png)


#### Title Metadata

`title` tag is used as the window title, the card title, blog post main header and also in twitter cards.

#### Description Metadata

Description metadata is used as HTML meta description tag, and in twitter cards.

#### Date Metadata

Date is used to for publication date. It is used to order to blog posts. It is displayed in the UI and in the RSS feed.

Date can be expressed in `MMM d, yyyy`

```markdown
---
...
..
.
date: April 9, 2020  
---

```

or `MMM d, yyyy HH:mm`
 
```markdown
---
...
..
.
date: April 9, 2020 09:00
---

```

**To Schedule tasks use a date in the future. Github Action runs daily and will publish scheduled posts.**

#### Blog post background

For Blog post background images usage image metadata. 

```markdown
---
...
..
.

```

Place the images at `assets/bgimages`

### Tags

To add tags just preffix them with `#`:

Example:

```markdown
Tags: #angular
```

**Webinars on-demand recordings should be tagged with `webinar`**

Release announcements should be tagged with `release`. 

Check the [list of tags](https://grails.org/blog/index.html) and try to reuse them. 

#### Code Highlighting

If your blog post, contains code samples add the following metadata:

```markdown
---
...
..
.
CSS: [%url]/stylesheets/prism.css
JAVASCRIPT: [%url]/javascripts/prism.js
---

# [%title]

```

#### Video

Use the `video` metadata to embed a Video. 

Currently, the plugin supports youtube videos. Use a link which starts with `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=` such as `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtjSqRZ_md4`

Example: 

```markdown
