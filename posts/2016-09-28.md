Today we are pleased to announce the GA releases of [Grails 3.2](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and [GORM 6.0](http://gorm.grails.org/latest/).

Each of these releases represents a significant step forward for the framework and marks the second major release since [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) began sponsoring development.

## GORM 6.0

[GORM 6.0](http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x) continues our goal of making GORM a standalone technology that can be used outside of Grails. By separating GORM from the Spring container, it is now easier to bootstrap and use GORM in a range of different scenarios, from Grails to Spring Boot to within a unit test.

In addition we have addressed often-requested features in GORM including:

*   Multiple Data Sources Support for MongoDB and Neo4j
*   Unified multi-tenancy support for Hibernate, MongoDB and Neo4j
*   GORM for MongoDB 3.3 driver
*   GORM for Neo4j 3.0 and Bolt Driver support
*   Unified configuration across all implementations

There is so much new and improved functionality in GORM that we prepared a dedicated "[What's New" guide](http://gorm.grails.org/latest/whatsNew/manual/index.html) just for GORM 6.0.

Also, check out the [brand new GORM 6 website](http://gorm.grails.org/latest/) for links to documentation for each implementation of GORM.

## RxGORM

In additional to the traditional GORM API, a new API for GORM has been introduced based on [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki) called [RxGORM](http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/rx/manual/index.html). With RxGORM you can write non-blocking, reactive data access code for supported implements.

For the first release of RxGORM, implementations for [MongoDB](http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/rx/manual/index.html) and [REST](http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/rx/rest-client/manual/index.html) are provided, with more implementations planned.

## Grails 3.2

Grails 3.2 bundles all of the goodness of GORM 6, plus a whole bunch of new features in the core framework:

*   RxJava support via a [new plugin](https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/rxjava).
*   Improved [JSON View](http://views.grails.org/) support.
*   AngularJS scaffolding
*   REST improvements
*   Latest and greatest libraries (Spring Boot 1.4, Gradle 3.0, etc.)

These are just some of the highlights. I recommend checking out the dedicated ["What's New"](http://docs.grails.org/3.2.x/guide/introduction.html#whatsNew) section in the brand new Asciidoctor-based [user guide](http://docs.grails.org/3.2.x) for more information.

Finally, thanks to all those who contributed feedback and issue reports to the release. We look forward to the continued participation of the Grails community as the framework continues to evolve.
