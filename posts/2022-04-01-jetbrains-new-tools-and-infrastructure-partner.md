The Grails Foundation™ is truly appreciative of the tremendous support we receive from our sponsors. In addition to financial support, generous contributions of development tools, infrastructure, and other resources are essential to the continued evolution of the Grails® framework. Our Tools and Infrastructure Partnership program recognizes the companies whose contributions enable us to maintain and expand both the open source technologies and the assets we rely on to keep our communities informed and engaged.

Today, we are pleased to announce that [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), producer of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), has joined the Grails Foundation as a [Tools and Infrastructure Partner](https://grails.org/foundation/sponsor-list.html#infrastructure)! In support of our organizations' shared values and goals within the open source ecosystem, JetBrains generously provides the Foundation with licenses to their incredible suite of products for our core development team!

As many Grails developers already know, the ultimate edition of IntelliJ IDEA includes [first-class support for the Grails Framework](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-grails3.html), as well as a host of features to increase developer productivity across a multitude of languages and frameworks. Those features help the Foundation's core development team do the necessary work to bring the open source Framework to the community.

We’re delighted to have JetBrains on board as a Tools and Infrastructure Partner. The JetBrains team's support for and excitement about Grails technology over the years has been tremendous. Their engagement in our community has been awesome, and we look forward to continued collaboration in the years to come. We truly appreciate the dedication and passion JetBrains has for open source projects. On behalf of the Grails Foundation, thank you! Initiatives like these that support and grow our Framework are the kinds of things we look for in a lifelong technology partner. 

The Grails Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that supports the Grails framework. The Foundation not only builds and supports an ecosystem of documentation, functionality, and services, it promotes and evangelizes the Framework as a leading technology in the JVM space. The generous support of our [Corporate Sponsors](https://grails.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#corporate) allows the Foundation to continue to ensure technical innovation and advancement of the Framework as a free and open public-use software development toolkit for our growing global community.
