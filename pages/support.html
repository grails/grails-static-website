            As the Grails framework grows and evolves, it also changes.  Some of these changes may not be compatible with older versions of the framework.  While the updates may be more ideal for the future, it may also make it more difficult for organizations to easily upgrade their Grails framework applications to the latest version.  For this reason, we are proud to offer premium product support for many versions of the Grails framework, including versions that have reached the end of public support.  For more information about premium support options for your Grails framework applications, please see our <a href="support-schedule.html">support schedule</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Our premium support packages include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolution or mitigation options for critical and high security vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>120 Ad-Hoc support hours</li>
            <li>3 seats to public Grails Foundation training events with a 30% discount on additional seats purchased</li>
