        <p>Today's savvy consumers expect e-commerce platforms to deliver engaging, intuitive shopping experiences and reliable, secure checkout systems. E-commerce merchants require the underlying technology to be robust enough to support their operations and agile enough to quickly and easily accommodate market, product, and traffic expansion.</p>
        <p>The open source Grails framework offers all the back-end power necessary to fulfill merchant needs with no vendor lock-in, contracts, license management, or run-time licensing fees. At the same time, it provides developers the flexibility to build modern applications that delight shoppers and support exceptional customer service.</p>

        <p>The Grails framework offers a powerful foundation designed to enable development teams to spend less time solving common web problems and more time implementing real business requirements. Additionally, the Grails framework is based on the Java platform and integrates with multiple mainstream technologies, including Groovy, Spring, Hibernate, and Gradle, allowing many companies to seamlessly merge upgrades with existing systems.</p>
